Extention is .rpg

BNF written but not working :Pog:. Things missing: type is not correct but can be added, error when trying to make an if ... then right now, why ¯_(ツ)_/¯. 

There is also extra naming like 'entity' since the language did not know when a new entity name was made, making it only possible to make one entity.
